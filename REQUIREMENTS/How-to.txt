# How to install the requirements?

Step 1:
```
Download the requirements.txt file
```

Step 2:

IF you are working on versions before Python 3.10.

```
Open the terminal , change directory to the folder where requirements.txt is , then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
  
```
Else for versions Python 3.10(included) and later , you need to create a seperate virtual environment to install your project libraries:
First install venv:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv

```
After that create and activate your virtual environment
```
to create an environment:-

```
python3 -m venv myenv


```

to activate :

```
source myenv/bin/activate

```

```
Now run the following :

pip install -r requirements.txt

Voilla!!! You are good to go!
